## Research Question

A question that can be asked based on the diabetes dataset is:
What is the predicted progression of diabetes given age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6 features?

### Abstract

The diabetes dataset presents ten measured features to track the progression of diabetes for 442 subjects. The progression is also presented as a feature called 'Y'.
The task at hand is to be able to predict the progression of diabetes (i.e. Y) by constructing a model using machine learning from the other features in the dataset.
Python data manipulation, data visualization, and machine learning libraries (e.g. numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn) will be used to create the data model that would predict Y.
A python script to construct the machine learning model from this dataset that would predict Y was written. Plots were made for exploratory purposes to visualize how the data were distributed and if any trends were apparent. Visualization was also to determine which features are best to include in the model. Machine learning model creating functions in the scikit-learn library were used to create the 'Y' predicting model.

4 sentence longer explanation about your research question. Include:

- opportunity (what data do we have)
- challenge (what is the "problem" we could solve with this dataset)
- action (how will we try to solve this problem/answer this question)
- resolution (what did we end up producing)

### Introduction

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about the dataset. Can copy from elsewhere, but cite the source (i.e. at least link, and explicitly say if it's copied from elsewhere).

### Methods

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about how you decided to approach solving it. Include:

- pseudocode for this method (either created by you or cited from somewhere else)
- why you chose this method

### Results

Brief (2 paragraph) description about your results. Include:

- At least 1 figure
- At least 1 "value" that summarizes either your data or the "performance" of your method
- A short explanation of both of the above

### Discussion
Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about what you did. Include:

- interpretation of whether your method "solved" the problem
- suggested next step that could make it better.
