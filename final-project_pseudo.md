Convert np array to pd dataframe

# Visualization
scatter plots of Y vs. features to see how data are distributed
Normalize, stratify by sex 2D scatter plot (Y vs. normalized feature score)

# Constructing model
run PCA on unstandardized data and standardized data (no categorical features)
determine minimum number of PCs needed to explain 95% of variance
visualize principal components

run a regression model (pick method based on how components look on a plot)
k nearest regression because the data appears to be randomly distributed and no strong correlations between the features and Y are apparent

compare raw, raw_pca, std_pca model scores

Do linear regression
machine learning - split dataset into training and testing sets
train and test model
Evaluate model
